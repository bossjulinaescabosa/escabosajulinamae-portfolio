 ## Reflection

Building my portfolio was a meaningful learning experience, but it also came with several challenges. One difficulty I encountered was setting up GitHub for the first time. At first, I struggled to understand the correct commands for pushing my files and keeping my repository updated. Another challenge I faced was organizing the file structure, especially when it came to images and linking them properly in the code. At times, my pictures did not appear on the site because of incorrect file paths. I solved this by carefully checking folder names, moving my images into a dedicated folder, and using relative paths in HTML.

Arranging the layout of my pages in a way that was both organized and visually appealing was also difficult. I initially had problems with alignment and spacing, which made the site look unpolished. To fix this, I revised my CSS step by step and experimented with different layouts until I achieved a cleaner design. Along the way, I also learned the importance of consistent folder structures and correct file paths.

Looking ahead, I want to improve my portfolio by adding more interactivity and polish. For example, I plan to include transitions and animations to make the navigation smoother and more engaging. I would also like to add a dark mode toggle to enhance user experience by giving visitors the option to choose their preferred theme, and make the site fully responsive so it looks professional on both desktop and mobile devices. Another improvement I envision is integrating a real contact form that allows visitors to reach me directly. Overall, this project taught me how to solve problems independently, explore new coding techniques, and use GitHub as a platform to share my work.
