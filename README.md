## About Me

Hello! I'm Julina Mae Escabosa, a dedicated musician and aspiring actor with a vibrant passion for the performing arts. Music is my core outlet, whether I'm breathing life into tunes on wind instruments such as the clarinet or saxophone, curating playlists that capture the essence of my favorite genres like ballad, pop, and RnB. Acting adds another layer to my creativity. I thrive on bringing characters to life through theater, short films, and improv, drawing from the raw emotion of storytelling.
