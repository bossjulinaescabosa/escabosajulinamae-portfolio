## About Me

Hello! I'm Julina Mae Escabosa, a dedicated musician and aspiring actor with a vibrant passion for the performing arts. Music is my core outlet, whether I'm breathing life into tunes on wind instruments such as the clarinet or saxophone, curating playlists that capture the essence of my favorite genres like ballad, pop, and RnB. Acting adds another layer to my creativity. I thrive on bringing characters to life through theater, short films, and improv, drawing from the raw emotion of storytelling.

 ## Reflection

Building my portfolio was a meaningful learning experience, but it also came with several challenges. One difficulty I encountered was setting up GitHub for the first time. At first, I struggled to understand the correct commands for pushing my files and keeping my repository updated. I faced was organizing the file structure, especially when it came to images and linking them properly in the code. My pictures were not showing on the site because of incorrect file paths. I solved this by carefully checking the folder names, moving my images into a dedicated folder, and using relative paths in HTML.

Another challenge was arranging the layout of my pages in a way that was both organized and visually appealing. I initially had problems with alignment and spacing, which made the site look unpolished. To solve this, I revised my CSS step by step and experimented with different layouts until I achieved a cleaner design. Making the images visible was also tricky, as I had to learn the importance of correct file paths and consistent folder structure.

Looking ahead, I want to improve my portfolio by adding more interactivity and polish. For example, I could include transitions and animations to make the navigation smoother and more engaging. I would add more interactive features such as a dark mode toggle to improve user experience by giving visitors the option to choose their preferred theme, and I would also like to make the site fully responsive so it looks professional on both desktop and mobile devices. Another possible improvement would be to integrate a real contact form that allows visitors to reach me directly. Overall, this project taught me how to solve problems independently, explore new coding techniques, and use GitHub as a platform to share my work.
